	<h2> DR. RUDRA MOHAN TRIPATHY </h2>
	
	<p> It is a very exciting to study Computer Science & Engineering (CSE). 
	    Few things have the transformative potential for humanity, as do Artificial intelligence (AI), Big-Data, and Robotics. 
		In contemporary society, the role of computer science has become and is becoming more and more important in all scientific fields, 
		such as medicine, pharmacy, economics, education, biochemistry, biotechnology, aerospace, decision science, management, Law, and the Arts. 
		In fact, computer science is considered to be one of the three significant elements for characterizing today’s world.
        Leveraging XIM University’s high-quality programs, we emphasize on sound computer science fundamentals, coding, research, innovation, and entrepreneurship.
		Currently, we offer B.Tech. in CSE, M.Tech. in DSA, and Ph.D. in CSE. At XIM University, we teach and follow both ethically and environmentally responsible engineering practices and believe 
		in inclusiveness and collaboration on a worldwide basis.As future leaders and innovators in technology, you have the power to make a difference in the world. Whether it's developing groundbreaking software, advancing artificial intelligence, 
		or leveraging technology for social good, your contributions can have a meaningful impact on society.
		In closing, I am excited to see what you will accomplish during your time at our school. Remember to dream big, work hard, and never stop learning. Together, we can shape the future of computer science and engineering.
